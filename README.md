A text-based game in javascript.
Yes, the name is very creative.

## Building

Everything's sorted out via Make. You should be good to go with:
```bash
make build
open index.html
```

## Why

No reason other than a small project to improve my command of the language and tooling.
It's not exactly a frontend wonder.

## License

This project is available under MIT license.
